Use is intended primarily for educational purposes. There is no promise anything here will work on your computer, with your compiler, in your IDE, etc.  I do my best to make it all work and worthwhile, but for the most part this code is only ever tested on a single Windows 8.1 machine, and occasionally on Windows 10 or in an Oracle Virtual Machine running a Linux distro. Rarely, these are done on a Raspberry Pi. If you're programming on a Mac, I have no idea if this code will cooperate with xcode, but I try not to use the windows.h library if I can avoid it, so most of this should work with only a few changes needed.

IDEs used: Dev C++, Netbeans. Sometimes made with Notepad++ or nano and compiled from command line.
Compilers used: x64 GNU GCC Toolchain (including make and gdb), and MinGWx64
